**Kobotoolbox Tutorial**

This is a comprehensive tutorial on [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), an open-source platform for data collection, management, and visualization widely used by nonprofit organizations. 
The tutorial guides users through the entire workflow: creating an account, building questionnaires with various question types, deploying forms, sharing them with respondents, and collecting data both online and offline using mobile devices. 
It provides detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots for each process, including how to bookmark forms for offline use, queue submissions when offline, and upload them when internet connectivity is restored. 
The tutorial is particularly focused on field data collection scenarios where internet access may be limited, making it valuable for researchers, aid workers, and others who need to gather information in remote or challenging environments.
