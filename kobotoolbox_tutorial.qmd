You will see a summary of the project, displaying the description, the project status, number of questions, the owner, last time modified and deployed. Also, on the bottom of the page you will see a chart and statistics of the submissions. 

To preview your questionnaire, click on `Preview form` on the Quick Links menu on the right of the screen.

![](kobotoolbox_tutorial_files/img/img12.png)

A temporary popup windows will show a complete functional version of the form. You can fill up the questions, but the responses will not be loaded to your project.

2. Deploy the questionnaire

Deploying your form is needed to make it available to the public, or to those who will be filling the form in the field. 

To deploy the form, click on `FORM` menu on the top of the screen, next to `SUMMARY`.
Then, click on the `DEPLOY` (or `REDEPLOY` if you made changes to the form) button.

Remember to redeploy your form each time you made changes to the questions in order to see them in the form you are sharing. 

3. Preparing the for before data collection

Before starting to collect data, you will want to set up the mode of collection. 
In the same window `FORM`, under the section `Collect data` you will see a drop-down menu with multiple options. Select the one that best adapts to the type of collection you will be doing. In this case, we will set it on `Online-Offline (multiple submissions)` as we want to collect data without being connected to the internet.

Now, to start collecting the data you can simply click on the `COPY` button to copy the URL of your form. You can share this url with the people that will be adding entries to the form. 

Or you can click on `OPEN` to open the form from the browser on the device you are using. 

## Collecting data on a mobile device

1. Once you open the URL of the form, if the form includes a location question, you will see a message asking to provide access to location services. Be sure to `allow access` if you want to be able to use the location of your phone in the form.
